The set of commits on 11/08/2022 were to save the current version of the code since there had been no recent commits.  The changes in these commits were made gradually over time since the previous commit in January 2022 and so the exact time that each change was made to the code is not know.  The current version of the code was reverted to the last commit (using stash to save the current version of the code) and the separate changes were then reintroduced and then commited individually as much as possible to document the different additions/corrections to the code, but this does not necessarily reflect the order that these were changes were made to the code originally.
